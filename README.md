# idontmind
23-24 mobile project

# Installation
Run the command `cd mobile && npm i && cd ../server && npm i && cd ..`.
Or run `npm i` separately from the mobile and server folders.

# Running
You should create two terminals, one based in the mobile directory for the mobile environment and one based in the server directory for running the server.

Then, run `npm start` in the server terminal and run `npx expo start` in the mobile terminal. Use the Expo Go App and the QR code to run the code on your mobile device.
